# LEADGen AI â€” Project Documentation

## Overview
LEADGen AI is a professional lead generation and analysis tool designed for venture capital firms and business analysts. It provides a modern, interactive web interface for analyzing company data, investment potential, and growth signals using advanced web scraping and AI analysis.

---

## Architecture

### Main Components
- **Streamlit UI (`leadgen_ui.py`):** The main user interface, handling all user interactions, data visualization, and export features.
- **AI Logic (`leadGENAI.py`):** (Expected) Handles data extraction, analysis, and report generation. Not included in this folder, but referenced in the UI.

### Data Flow
1. **User Input:**
   - Users enter a company name or upload a batch file via the sidebar.
2. **Analysis Trigger:**
   - On clicking "Analyze Company", the UI calls `LeadGenAI.extract_company_profile()` to fetch and analyze data.
3. **Progress Feedback:**
   - The UI shows a progress bar and status updates during analysis.
4. **Results Display:**
   - Results are displayed in a tabbed interface: Overview, Financial, Growth, Team & Contact, and Raw Data.
5. **Export:**
   - Users can export results in JSON, Markdown, or plain text formats.

- **Custom Visualizations:**
  - Add new Plotly charts or Streamlit components for deeper insights.
- **Authentication:**
  - Add user authentication for multi-user or SaaS deployments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit, pandas, plotly, and other dependencies in `requirements_ui.txt`
- `leadGENAI.py` (not included) for core AI logic

---

## Known Limitations
- The core AI/data extraction logic (`leadGENAI.py`) is not included in this folder.
- Batch analysis is a placeholder and not yet implemented.
- Some visualizations use placeholder data if real data is missing.
